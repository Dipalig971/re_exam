# Habit Tracker App

## A powerful and user-friendly Flutter Habit Tracker app that helps users build and maintain daily habits while tracking their progress. The app combines local storage using SQLite with cloud backup and synchronization using Firebase, providing seamless offline functionality and data accessibility across multiple devices.

### Features
- Habit Management: Create, update, delete, and track habits with customizable fields:

- Habit Name: Define the habit you want to track.
Target Days: Set a target number of days to complete the habit.
Progress Tracking: Mark daily progress to see how close you are to reaching your goals.
Local Storage with SQLite:

- Stores habit data locally using SQLite, ensuring data is accessible even without an internet connection.
Allows for quick access and updates to habit data with fast, reliable local storage.
Cloud Synchronization with Firebase:

- Syncs habit data with Firebase Firestore to keep habits backed up and synchronized across devices.
Automatically updates the cloud when changes are made locally and restores data when a user signs in on a new device.
User Authentication:

- Secure login/signup functionality using Firebase Authentication.
Ensures that each user's habits are stored privately and can only be accessed by their respective accounts.
Offline Support:

- Access and update habit data even when offline, with changes being synced to Firebase when back online.
Ideal for users with intermittent internet access or those who need a reliable offline experience.
